"""
Maps SPDX license identifiers into broad license "families" so the
classifier has a small, balanced target instead of a dozen sparse
exact-license classes.

Permissive: minimal restrictions, can be reused in closed-source projects
            (MIT, Apache-2.0, BSD variants, ISC, etc.)
Copyleft:   derivative works must stay open-source under similar terms
            (GPL, LGPL, AGPL, MPL, EPL, etc.)
Unknown:    no license detected, GitHub couldn't determine one, or the
            id isn't in our known lists (treated conservatively)
